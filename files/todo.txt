todo
=======================
- OBJECTIVE: get basic data flow done:  cron pulls data, store to postgres
- finish up cron first! (fetch for each language --> store in postgres)
  - make sure cron works!
- split cron job into helper file, need to write unit tests for helper

CURRENTLY (as of sunday midnight, dec 21):
  - trying to get `coffee src/cron/fetch-repos.coffee` to work
    - need to fix languages.cson or fake data


- testing:
  - need to export custom_env for models/postgres
  - create logger class, grab loggly info

- src/models/postgres:
  - confirm process.current_env works
  - confirm singleton works
- create modular router

- business logic:
  - create a list of languages to poll
  - create list of file extensions to recognize (e.g. c: .cc, .cpp, .cp, .cxx)
  - ensure the languages are supported on github

- data requirements:
  - elasticsearch mappings
  - postgres schemas
  - corresponding schema between elasticsearch and postgres
    - e.g. should postgres know where an object is in elasticsearch (via foreign key)?

- data retrieval workflow:
  1. chron job: every week, query github for trending repos for each language
    - store repo metadata in postgres
  2. wget every compressed repo for every language
    - update repo metadata to show downloaded status
  3. comb through repo, pulling only appropriate files with correct extensions
  4. store those sample code files (e.g. "util.js") into elasticsearch
    - need to figure out a way to limit/filter files (e.g. max of 25mb, count 5 files)
    - use node-exec to execute bash script to `find ./ -iname *.coffee`
    - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7464036/node-js-shell-script-and-arguments
  5. cross-index these files from postgres to elasticsearch.  
      mark down filename, id, and ES _id, _type (to uniquely identify).

- viewing
  - hover over image shows unclickable, formatted code as text
  - previous and next

- databases
  - elasticache: file storage and search
  - postgres/sqlite: metadata on repos, languages, searches
  - redis: sessions and caching

=======================
in progress
=======================
- create github model (now testing)
- write tests


=======================
won't fix
=======================
- explore gulp? 


=======================
done
=======================
- global before and after with server running mocha
- setup travis
- split grunt tests (functional, unit, etc)
- investigate class/instances in server
- move from makefile to grunt
